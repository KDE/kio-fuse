How to use kio-fuse
===================

Building
--------

Very simple: Install fuse3 and KIO, run cmake, make and you're done!

Running
-------

Create a new directory somewhere, make sure that no daemon is going to clean
up after it (like systemd-tmpfiles in /run/user/...) and run kio-fuse -d $dir.
The "-d" means that it shows debug output and does not daemonize - that makes
it easier to use it at first.

In the directory you'll find a new empty file _control which is used to send
commands to kio-fuse. Let's assume you want to make the files at
ftp://user:password@server/directory accessible in your local file system.
To send the corresponding mount command, run

echo "MOUNT ftp://user:password@server/directory" >> $dir/_control

If it failed, kio-fuse wrote the error message returned by kio into your
terminal. If it succeeded, you won't see any output and the hierarchy is
accessible at $dir/ftp/user@server/directory.

After your work is done, simply run "fusermount -u $dir" to unmount the URL and
exit kio-fuse.

Have a lot of fun!
