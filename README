How to use kio-fuse
===================

Building
--------

Very simple: Install build dependencies, run cmake, make and you're done!

To install build dependencies on Arch Linux:

    pacman -S base-devel fuse3 cmake extra-cmake-modules qt5base kio

To install build dependencies on Fedora 32:

    dnf install cmake extra-cmake-modules kf5-kio-devel fuse3-devel 
    qt5-qtbase-devel pkg-config

To install build dependencies on openSUSE Tumbleweed:

    zypper install extra-cmake-modules 'cmake(KF5KIO)' 'pkgconfig(fuse3)' 
    kio-devel 'cmake(Qt5Test)' 'cmake(Qt5Dbus)'

To install build dependencies on Ubuntu 19.04:

    apt install fuse3 libfuse3-dev build-essential cmake extra-cmake-modules
    pkg-config libkf5kio-dev

To run the tests, run make test. To install, run make install.

Using
-----

kio-fuse is a DBus activated service, so for permanent installation the
installed service file has to be in a directory used by dbus-daemon.
If you're installing into a custom prefix, you may want to link
[prefix]/share/dbus-1/services/org.kde.KIOFuse.service into
~/.local/share/dbus-1/services/ and
[prefix]/lib/systemd/user/kio-fuse.service into
~/.local/share/systemd/user/.

To make sure that the installed version is actually used, stop any already
running instance with "killall kio-fuse" and log out and in again.

For quick testing, installation and DBus activation can be skipped. Instead,
after stopping any previously running instance, start the built kio-fuse binary
with the -f parameter and possibly other options.

The DBus service is automatically used by KIO (5.66+) when opening a file on a
KIO URL with a KIO-unaware application.

Running it manually
-------------------

Create a new directory somewhere, make sure that no daemon is going to clean
up after it (like systemd-tmpfiles in /run/user/...) and run kio-fuse -d $dir.
The "-d" means that it shows debug output and does not daemonize - that makes it
easier to use it at first.

In your session bus you'll find a org.kde.KIOFuse service with an interface that
allows one to communicate with the kio-fuse process.

Let's assume you want to make the files at
ftp://user:password@server/directory accessible in your local file system.
To send the corresponding mount command, type the following in the command line:
dbus-send --session --print-reply --type=method_call \
          --dest=org.kde.KIOFuse \
                 /org/kde/KIOFuse \
                 org.kde.KIOFuse.VFS.mountUrl string:ftp://user:password@server/directory

If it failed, kio-fuse will reply with an appropriate error message. If it
succeeded, you will get the location that the URL is mounted on as a reply. In
this case it would be $dir/ftp/user@server/directory and the directory will be
accessibly at that URL.

After your work is done, simply run "fusermount3 -u $dir" to unmount the URL and
exit kio-fuse.

Have a lot of fun!
