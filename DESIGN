Single-threaded dispatch:
- KIO can only dispatch in the main event loop's thread anyway
- It's impossible to keep a node's lookup count otherwise:

- Integrates well with the Qt main loop
- Avoids expensive and complicated locking

Lowlevel API:
- Asynchronous
- Can access files without having to call readdir on all path elements
  (necessary for HTTP, makes other slaves quicker)
- Lets the FUSE daemon implement unlinking properly. With the high-level API,
  calling unlink on a still opened file results in a rename(..., ".fuse_hiddenXXX") instead,
  which is undesirable
