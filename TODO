- opendir/readdir/releasedir could be more POSIX compliant by increasing the lookup count of
  children and storing a copy of childrenInos in fuse_file_info.
- Install own signal handlers
- Handle more FUSE ops:
  * mknod
  * unlink
  * rename
  * statvfs
  * setattr with modification time
  * ACLs (?)
- Deal with invalid size reporting slaves (http/...)?
- Evaluate dynamic_cast compared to own implementation
- Does O_APPEND need special treatment in write or is using off enough?
- Do st_[acm]tim need to be updated manually?
- Fix kdeconnect:// to return all children in readdir and not just an incomplete list of broken
  links (or add a workaround?)
- Refresh attributes of files/dirs and children of dirs after a while
- Flush dirty cache files automatically after being unused for a while
- Drop unused cache files after a while (?)
- Look into using KIO::read/KIO::write if possible:
  * Needs ::open to succeed, has state per slave (?)
  * Does not support truncation, so ::put is still necessary
