- opendir/readdir/releasedir could be more POSIX compliant by increasing the lookup count of
  children and storing a copy of childrenInos in fuse_file_info.
- Install own signal handlers
- Handle more FUSE ops:
  * setattr on directories
  * link (to allow relinking of deleted nodes only, like O_TMPFILE)
  * statvfs (?)
  * ACLs (?)
  * interrupting requests (just killing the KIO Job would also break other requests for the
    same resource)
- Deal with invalid size reporting slaves (http/gdrive/...)?
- Deal with slaves which don't support stat (fonts/...)?
- Fix kdeconnect:// to return all children in readdir and not just an incomplete list of broken
  links (or add a workaround?)
- Refresh attributes of files/dirs and children of dirs after a while:
- Flush dirty cache files automatically after being unused for a while
- Drop unused cache files after a while (?) (important to notify the kernel about this to avoid
  desync)
- Look into using KIO::read/KIO::write if possible:
  * Needs ::open to succeed, has state per slave (?)
  * Does not support truncation, so ::put is still necessary
