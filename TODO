- opendir/readdir/releasedir could be more POSIX compliant by increasing the lookup count of
  children and storing a copy of childrenInos in fuse_file_info.
- Install own signal handlers
- Handle more FUSE ops
- Implement st_mode access bits
- Deal with invalid size reporting slaves (http/settings/...)?
- Evaluate dynamic_cast compared to own implementation
- Does O_APPEND need special treatment in write or is using off enough?
- Do st_[acm]tim need to be updated manually?
- Fix kdeconnect:// to return all children in readdir and not just an incomplete list of broken
  links (or add a workaround?)
